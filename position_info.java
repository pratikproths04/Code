	仔细研究面经: 一亩三分地面经版有大量地里同学们分享的各公司面试题目。按照公司标签把题目找出来，认真准备，你有很高的概率会遇到原题。
	Leetcode + 一亩三分地面经，基本上就完整了。

	以下是大家常用的投简历申请工作的途径：
		LinkedIn加人，尤其是校友（无论国内国内、高中大学还是研究生，街坊邻居也可以），
		总之到处找人帮忙，如果对方所在公司招人，请ta内推；也可以针对目标公司来找人、加人
		Career Fair，大多数学校有两次，一次是秋季招聘会，一般在9-10月，也就是开学后不久；
		另一次是春季招聘会，一般在2月前后。去学校摆摊的，一般都是有职位要招人，而且考虑new grad（应届生）。
		一亩三分地有内推版，有很多公司的员工愿意帮你提供内推。
		我们还有一个企业直聘版，目前尚在建设中。
		海投简历对绝大多数人来说，必不可少。大家常用的网站有 Indeed、Monster、Dice。
