Behind the Scenes: {
	screening interview --> interview in-person
	oneline synchronized document editors
	write code on paper and read it back over the phone
	1 or 2 screening interview then on-site
	In an on-site interview round, 3-6 in-person interview
	one of them is over lunch and not technical, interviewer may not even submit feedback, 
	good timing to discuss interests with and to ask about the company culture
	other interviews will mostly technical and will involve a combination of coding, algorithm, design/architecture, ..

	After the interview, will provide feedback in some form
	interviewers discuss performance and come to a decision
	interviewers submit a recommendation to HR or HR committee
	interviewers do not make decision and let HR committee make

	Most companies get back after about a week with next steps
	(offer, rejection, further interviews, or just an update on the process)

	If waited more than a week, should follow up with recruiter
	if he/she does not respond, does not mean you are rejected, indicates nothing about your status
	the intention is that all recruiters should tell candidates once a final decision is made

	Delays can happen, follow up with your recruiter if you expect a Delays
	be respectfil when you do that
	They are busy and forgetful

	Microsoft Interview:{

Special Situations: {

Before the Interview: {
	Writing a Great Resume: {
		Programming Languages and Software:

Behavioral Questions: {
	Interview Preparation Grid for each project
	What are your weaknesses? give a real weakness but emphasizes how you work to overcome it
	What questions should you ask the interviewer: {
		Genuine Questions: {
			1. "What is the ratio of testers to developers to program managers? 
			What is the interaction like? How does project planning happen on the team?"
			2. "What brought you to this company? What has been most challenging for you?"
		}

		}
	}
}


Special Situations: {
	Testers and SDETs:
		1.	
}


Techical Questions: {
	How to Prepare: {
		For each problem, do the following: {
			1.	Try to solve the problem on your own;
			2.	Write the code on paper;
			3.	Test your code--on paper, test general cases, base cases, and error cases;
			4.	Type your paper code as-is into a computer.
		}
		try to do as many mock interviews as possible;
	}
	What you need to know: {
		Core Data Structures, Algorithms, and Concepts: {
			the list of the absolute, must-have knowledge: {
				Data Structures: {
					Linked Lists;
					Trees, Tries, Graphs;
					Stacks, Queues;
					Heaps;
					Vectors, ArrayLists;
					Hash Tables;
				}
				Algorithms: {
					BFS;
					DFS;
					Binary Search;
					Merge Sort;
					Quick Sort;
				}
				Concepts: {
					Bit Manipulation;
					Memory (Stack Heap);
					Recursion;
					DP;
					Big O time and space;
				}
			}
		}
		Powers of 2 Table;
	}
	Optimize & Solve Technique #1: Look for BUD: {
		Bottlenecks
		Unnecessary work
		Duplicated work
	}
	When you have heard a question before: {
		admit this to your interviewer?
	}
}


The Offer and Beyond: {
	Handling Oﬀers and Rejection: {
		Oﬀer Deadlines and Extensions:  Companies will usually try to accommodate this, if possible;
		Declining an Oﬀer: {
			provide a reason that is non-oﬀensive and inarguable. For example, if you were
			declining a big company for a startup, you could explain that you feel a startup is the right choice for you
			at this time.
		}
		Handling Rejection: {
			Thank your recruiter for his time, explain that you are disappointed but that you understand their position, and ask when
			you can reapply to the company;
			You can also ask for feedback from the recruiter.
		}
	}
	Evaluating the Oﬀer: {
		The Financial Package: {
			Signing Bonus, Relocation, and Other One Time Perks: wise to amortize this cash over three years;
			Cost ofLiving Diﬀerence: Taxes and other cost of living diﬀerences can make a big difference;
			Annual Bonus;
			Stock Options and Grants;
		}
		what you learn and how a company advances your career ofen 
		makes far more of a difference to your long term fnances than the salary;
		Career Development: {
			how this offer would impact your career path: {
				1.	How good does the company name look on my resume?
				2.	How much will I learn? Will I learn relevant things?
				3.	What is the promotion plan? How do the careers of developers progress?
				4.	If I want to move into management, does this company offer a realistic plan?
				5.	Is the company or team growing?
				6.	If I do want to leave the company, is it situated near other companies I am interested in, or will I need to move?
			}
			The fnal point is extremely important and usually overlooked.
			Company Stability
			The Happiness Factor: {
				1.	The Product;
				2.	Manager and Teammates;
				3.	Company Culture;
				4.	Hours;
			}
			Negotiation: {
				1.	Not surprisingly, in a class poll, most of these students also said they didn't 
					negotiate their job offer. They just accepted whatever the company gave them.
				2.	Negotiate. Here are some tips to get you started: {
					1. Just Do It;
					2. Have a Viable Alterative: recruiters negotiate with you because they are concerned you may not join the company otherwise
					3. Have a Specifc "Ask": more effective to ask for an additional $7000 in salary than to just ask for"more";
					4. Overshoot;
					5. Tink Beyond Salary: Companies are ofen more willing to negotiate on non-salary components: {
						Consider asking for more equity or a bigger signing bonus. 
						Alternatively, you may be able to ask for your relocation benefts in cash, 
						instead of having the company pay directly for the moving fees. 
						This is a great avenue for many college students, whose actual moving expenses are fairly cheap
					}
				}
			}
			On the job: {
				1.	Set a Timeline: {
					When you're enjoying your job, it's very easy to get wrapped up in it and not realize that your career is not advancing;
					This is why you should outline your career path before starting a new job;
				}
				2.	Build Strong Relationships: {
					establish strong relationships with your manager and teammates;
					When employees leave, keep in touch with them;
					a friendly note a few weeks after their departure will help to bridge that 
					 	connection from a work acquaintance to a personal acquaintance;
				}
				3.	Ask for What You Want: {
					Be (reasonably) frank about your goals with your manager. 
					If you want to take on more back-end coding projects, say so.
				}
				4.	Keep Interviewing: {
					keep your interview skills fresh, and also keep you in tune with what sorts of opportunities (and salaries) are out there
				}
